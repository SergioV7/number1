# My Project

This small project demonstrates a basic Python program organized in a simple
package structure. The script asks for your name and a number, then prints the
number doubled.

## Running the Program

```bash
python -m my_project.src.main
```

## Running Tests

The tests use Python's built-in `unittest` framework:

```bash
python -m unittest discover my_project/tests
```
